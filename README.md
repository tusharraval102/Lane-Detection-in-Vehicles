# Lane-Detection-in-Vehicles

## Description

The goal of this project is to detect lanes using various image processing techniques. The main techniques involve using Canny Edge detection, and Hough Lane transforms.

## Steps taken to detect lanes

1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Apply a Gaussian Blur
3. Apply a Canny Edge Detection
4. Apply a mask to the image
5. Apply a Hough Line Transform
6. Merge the lines onto the original image

## Dataset

The dataset was found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vonsj0210/Multi-Lane-Detection-Dataset-with-Ground-Truth). The video that was used is titled [IMG_0267.MOV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iO6EUira1_irMHnEFjma3vc8LfYKHmQ4) which can be found on Google Drive.
